# SANS Holiday Hack 2024
## Challenge #1: Linux 101
[[/linux_101/linux_101_header.png | Linux101 Overview]]
The North Pole üéÅ Present Maker:
All the presents on this system have been stolen by trolls. Capture trolls by following instructions here and üéÅ's will appear in the green bar below. Run the command "hintme" to receive a hint.

As with past years this seems like the using Linux command line tutorial.

#### T1: Perform a directory listing of your home directory to find a troll and retrieve a present!
```bash
elf@51d9124a0b27:~$ ls
HELP  troll_19315479765589239  workshop
```
#### T2: Now find the troll inside the troll.

#### T3: Great, now remove the troll in your home directory.

#### T4: Print the present working directory using a command.

#### T5: Good job but it looks like another troll hid itself in your home directory. Find the hidden troll!

#### T6: Excellent, now find the troll in your command history.

#### T7: Find the troll in your environment variables.
